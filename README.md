# Church Attendance Tracker

This project is similar to Canva or Magister used in schools for checking if students are present or absent.
In this project not only will we do that but more. Here under are the things this project must have in order to complete
this 100%.

## Primary Goals
- **Track User Attendance**: Mark users as either "Present" or "Absent" for specific dates.
- **Database Integration**: Seamlessly connect and interact with the database to manage attendance records.

- **Dynamic Rankings**: Automatically update rankings whenever changes are made to attendance data.
- **Attendance Insights**: Display statistics for the most frequent absentees and attendees.
- **Export Data**: Export all attendance data into an Excel file with a single click.
- **Daily Attendance**: Allow attendance tracking for new dates while maintaining historical records.
- **Historical Updates**: Enable editing of attendance records for past dates, ensuring rankings are updated accordingly.

## Extra Goals (Optional)
- **Graphical Insights**: Include visual representations of attendance trends:
  - **Bar Graphs**: Display attendance counts by date.
  - **Pie Charts**: Visualize the proportion of presence and absence.
  - **Table Views**: Provide a tabular representation of detailed attendance data.
- **Absentee Alerts**: Automatically generate a list of users who have been absent for a specified number of consecutive weeks.
