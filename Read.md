# Church Attendance Tracker

This project is similar to Canva or Magister used in schools for checking if students are present or absent.
In this project not only will we do that but more. Here under are the things this project must have in order to complete
this 100%.

## Goals
```
* Check users attendance : present or absent
* Could connect to the database 
* Ranking System to see who is the most present and Absent
* Could Edit if a mistake was done 
* Updates the Ranking every time something is changed 
* Data that shows the most absentee's and the opposite 
* With a click of a button we can export the data into an excel file 
* checking the user's attendance is new by a new date 
* we could go back to and old date to change something which should still update the rankings
```

### Extra Goals(Optional)
* A graph to see which date most people where present ,
* Circular graph
